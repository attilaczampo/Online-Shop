Struct VS Class

The main difference between the 2 is that, STRUCTS are VALUE TYPES, while CLASSES are REFERENCE TYPES.

INHERITANCE:
      @ STRUCTS : Don't support inheritance;
      @ CLASSES : Support inheritance;
      
NULL REFERENCE:
      # STRUCTS : Cannot have null references;
      # CLASSES : Can have null references;
      
LOGIC:
      $ STRUCTS : Light on logic, they support data;
      $ CLASSES : Contain complex logic behind;
      
PARAMETERLESS CONSTRUCTOR :
      * Both can have parameterless constructors.
