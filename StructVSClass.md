# Struct VS Class

The main difference between the 2 is that, STRUCTS are VALUE TYPES, while CLASSES are REFERENCE TYPES.

## INHERITANCE:
      @ STRUCTS : - Don't support inheritance; 
                  - A Struct is not allowed to inherit from another struct or class.
                  - Function member of the struct cannot be virtual or abstract.
      @ CLASSES : - Support inheritance; 
                  - can inherit from another class.
                  - Function member of the class can be virtual or abstract.
      
## NULL REFERENCE:
      # STRUCTS : Cannot have null references;
      # CLASSES : Can have null references;
      
## PROTECTED ACCESS MODIFIER:
      * The data member of a class can be protected.
      * The data member of struct canâ€™t be protected.
      
## LOGIC:
      $ STRUCTS : Light on logic, they support data;
      $ CLASSES : Contain complex logic behind;
      
## PARAMETERLESS CONSTRUCTOR :
      * A CLASS can have a parameterless constructor.
      * A STRUCT does not contain parameter less constructor, but can contain Parameterized constructor or static constructor.
 
## New Keyword:
      * Classes use new keyword for creating instances.
      * Structs can create an instance, with or without new keyword.

## INTERFACES :
      Just like classes, a struct can also implement from an interface.

## DEFAULT VALUES:
      *Default value for classes: null;
      *Default value for struct can not be null. The default value of a struct is the value produced by setting all value type fields to their default value and all reference type fields to null
