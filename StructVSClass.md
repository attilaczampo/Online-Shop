# Struct VS Class

The main difference between the 2 is that, STRUCTS are VALUE TYPES, while CLASSES are REFERENCE TYPES.

## INHERITANCE:
      @ STRUCTS : Don't support inheritance;
      @ CLASSES : Support inheritance;
      
## NULL REFERENCE:
      # STRUCTS : Cannot have null references;
      # CLASSES : Can have null references;
      
## LOGIC:
      $ STRUCTS : Light on logic, they support data;
      $ CLASSES : Contain complex logic behind;
      
## PARAMETERLESS CONSTRUCTOR :
      * Both can have parameterless constructors.

## INTERFACES :
      Just like classes, a struct can also implement from an interface.

## *** DEFAULT VALUES ***

Default value for classes: null;
Default value for struct can not be null.
