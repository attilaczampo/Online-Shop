## About The Project

This app is a C# console app, in which are presented multiple C# topics, like Inheritance, Abstract classes, Constructor types and so on.
Each topic is presented in it's own project assembly, making the code easier to read.

We have multiple classes, the Details.cs class being the BASE Class.
The Phone, PC and TV classes inherit from the base class, which is an ABSTRACT Class.

This classes inherit through CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS(). We've looked and saw the differences
between abstract methods and virtual methods. Also, we defined a PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR in the Base class, and we saw the use of the "base" keyword in the derived classes.

We added 2 more new classes: Watch.cs and Food.cs. 
The app also focuses on showing different CONSTRUCTOR TYPES. We have multiple types: parameterless, parameterized, default, copy, private and static constructor.

Multiple Projects - each project showcasing C# 'hot' topics.

MyApp project - Abstract Classes, virtual methods, inheritance.
Project A - Structs 
Project B - Constructor Types
Procet C - Is operator
Project D - As operator
