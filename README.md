Basic console app, to show relations through Inheritance; Abstract Classes; Virtual Methods; Constructor Types.

This app shows the relation of classes through INHERITANCE.

We have multiple classes, the Details.cs class being the BASE Class.
The Phone, PC and TV classes inherit from the base class, which is an ABSTRACT Class.

This classes inherit through CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS(). We've looked and saw the differences
between abstract methods and virtual methods. Also, we defined a PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR in the Base class, and we saw the use of the "base" keyword in the derived classes.

We added 2 more new classes: Watch.cs and Food.cs. 
The app also focuses on showing different CONSTRUCTOR TYPES. We have multiple types: parameterless, parameterized, default, copy, private and static constructor.
