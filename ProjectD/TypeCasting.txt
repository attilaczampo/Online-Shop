AS Operator

The 'as' operator, attempts to cast an object to a specific type, adn returns null, if it fails.

We cannot type-cast base type to derived types.

Student student = new Student
{
	...
	...
}

// Casting :

JuniorStudent juniorStudent = student as JuniorStudent; --> casting is going to fail, so juniorStudent will be null.

if (juniorStudent == null)
	Cwriteline("juniorStudent is null")
else
	cw-line("juniorStudent is not null")

...
...
...
...


	What is the difference between Cast operator and As operator ?

	Cast operator throws an exception if the conversion fails (crasheli az appot)
	As operator returns NULL if the conversion fails.
